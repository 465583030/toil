# Toil landing page

Landing page stylesheet is built off of Yahoo's Pure CSS library, which was ported
to Sass and vendored via submodule. Do `make build` to generate production CSS
(Sass must be installed).

Github Pages doesn't actually generate anything, so you'll have to commit the
generated CSS.
