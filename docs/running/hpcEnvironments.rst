Running in HPC Environments
===========================

Toil is a flexible framework that can be leveraged in a variety of environments, including high-performance computing (HPC) environments.  

Currently, Toil is not supported to run in HPC environments, but there are members of the Toil community currently deploying Toil in HPC environments such as `Grid Engine`_ and `Slurm`_.
